Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

Brain MRIs are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 224x224 (Fit (black edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 5 versions of each source image in ModerateDemented:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.7 pixels
The dataset includes 1039 images.

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image in MildDemented:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.7 pixels
The dataset includes 13575 images.

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image in VeryMildlDemented:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -11 and +11 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.7 pixels
The dataset includes 18124 images.

No Roboflow image augmentation techniques were applied in NonDemented.
The following torch transform augmentations were applied in-place, keeping the image count the same:

The dataset includes 22705 images.
